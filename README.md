# Jurassic App
An educational app aimed at young children created by 5 members of E51 for CodeClan's Professional Software Development Course. 

The aim was to use technologies taught in the previous weeks - React, JavaScript, MongoDB. Additionally, other tools and libraries such as Canvas, a drag and drop library, and React Router were researched and functionality was developed and added accordingly.

Children can read information about dinosaurs, then take a short quiz based on the information they have read. Children can also play 5 dinosaur-themed games.
